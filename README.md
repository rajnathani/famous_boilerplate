local, concatenated and jaded version of the famo.us boilerplate

## Files meant to be deleted

	- boilerplate.sh
	- .gitignore
	- .git
	- README.md (you guessed right, the file currently being read)

## Files which could be deleted

	- src/famous-minus-require.min.js (this build is meant for your project if you already have `require.js` loaded, in any other case delete it)
	- src/unconcat/ (this directory contains the (5) files used to create the build `src/famous.min.js`, delete it unless you prefer working with the unbuilt version)
	- index.jade (this jade file generates the `index.html`, in case you do not plan on working with jade, you can trash this file too)
